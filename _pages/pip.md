# What is PIP？
**A Personal Interest Project (PIP) is a self-driven exploration fueled by curiosity and passion, much like an intellectual hobby.** These projects allow me to dive deep into new mathematical concepts, programming frameworks, or other technical topics that capture my interest. While I may seek guidance or discussions with others, the core work is independently pursued. Given their exploratory nature, these projects often demand sustained effort—sometimes spanning weeks of focused work or evolving intermittently over years. Each PIP serves as a testament to self-directed learning, persistence, and the joy of discovery.

PIPs
======
1. **Simple model for Atmosphere**. TBD. *Concept*.
  * Dynamical core + Radiative transfer. Study atmosphere dynamics under various conditions.
  * Python for simulations, which may make it easier for grad-calc in CNOP.
1. **Evolution equation simulation, but random variables**. 2024/09. **Still updating**.
  * PDE simulation, but initial value is randomly given according to certain distribution, what is the evolution of the distribution?
  * First diffusion eq. (Linear), then Bergers equation or Lorenz models (Nonlinear).
  * Still learning mathematical tools.
  * Currently start with ODE first.
  * See [Relevant blogposts](https://vortexer99.github.io/tags/#PIP-RANDPDE).
1. **Personal Website**. 2023/10. *Still updating*.
  * [Current website](https://vortexer99.github.io)
  * Jekyll and Github Pages for deployment, academicpages for template, Markdown for texts.
1. **LMD Mars PCM Simulation Controller**. 2022/11. *Still updating*.
  * To quickly initialize, submit and collect large amount of LMD Mars PCM experiments.
  Parameters can be easily assigned. 
  * Also perform required actions for BV & RP & CNOP.
  * YAML for config settings, Shell and Python for actions.

PIPs (Inactive)
======
1. **A calculator for a specific use**. 2024/04. *Finish*.
  * Calculation by tag-matching from data. 
  * Vue.js for UI, JavaScript for core logic. YAML for storing data.
  * Deployed via GitHub Pages.
1. **Fast-changing BV tests**. 2023/12. *Mostly done, not continuing for now*.
  * Simple models. If the fast-growing direction changes very fast, would BV able to catch up?
  * Matlab for simulation.
1. **A simulator for a specific use**. 2023/03. *Finish*.
  * Step forward in time to simulate state changes, event series and rules given.
  * wxPython for UI, matplotlib for display, Python for core logic. 
1. **A calculator and a simulator for a specific use**. 2021/10. *Finish*.
  * Calculate from adjustable basic settings. Simulate from event series and rules given.
  * Excel for calculator, Mathematica for simulator.
1. **Personal Website**. 2018/04-2022/09. *Finish*
  * 庄逸的数学和技术屋
  * Tencent Cloud (Student) for server，Wordpress for engine, with MySQL & PHP.
1. **My Math handbook**. 2016/11-2017/09. *Finish*.
  * “高中数学学习参考” or 《学霸带你玩转高中数学》
  * Word for formatting.
