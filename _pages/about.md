This is Yi Zhuang's new home on the web! (Still under construction though)

关于我 About me
======
欢迎来到庄逸的个人主页。我是一名就读于[中国科学院大气物理研究所](https://iap.cas.cn/)的四年级博士研究生，导师为[段晚锁研究员](http://duanws.lasg.ac.cn/)，研究方向是**火星大气可预报性**。
具体而言，我所进行的研究工作主要包括以下几个方面。
1. 可预报性的具体研究内容与数值研究方法，提高预报技巧的手段；
1. 火星大气基本性质，重要动力、物理过程的剖析；
1. 火星模式（目前主要使用[LMD Mars PCM](http://www-planets.lmd.jussieu.fr/)）的应用。

在研究工作之外，我会撰写一些和数学物理有关的[博文](/year-archive/)，或者探究一些[个人兴趣项目](/pip/)。也可以通过[CV](/cv/)了解更多信息。

Welcome to Yi Zhuang's personal website. I am a fourth year PhD student in [IAP-CAS]((https://iap.cas.cn/)) and my supervisor is [Prof. Wansuo Duan](http://duanws.lasg.ac.cn/index/index/enindex.html). Currently I am researching on **the predictability of the Martian atmosphere**. More specifically, my research mainly includes the following aspects.
1. How to quantify predictability and associated numerical methods, as well as improving forecast skills.
1. Understanding the properties of the Martian atmosphere and important dynamical & physical processes.
1. Running Martian atmosphere model (Currently [LMD Mars PCM](http://www-planets.lmd.jussieu.fr/)).

Aside from main research works, I often write [blogs](/year-archive/) of mathematical or physical problems, or explore [personal interest projects](/pip/). You may also refer to [CV](/cv/) for more information.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
