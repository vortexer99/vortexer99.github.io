RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
======
**Predictability of the Martian atmosphere**

2022/08 - present. IAP/CAS, China

Advisor: [Prof. Wansuo Duan](http://duanws.lasg.ac.cn/)

* We reveal a novel season-dependent weather predictability barrier phenomenon in the Martian atmosphere.
* We build numerical optimization program adapting the Spectral Projection Gradient method to solve the Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation (CNOP) in the LMD Mars model. The CNOP represents initial errors which induce largest forecast error, and indicates predictability limit for Martian atmosphere.
* With the help of CNOP, We conduct Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) to quantify the improvement of forecast level through assimilation with targeted observation. (*planned*)

**Effects of Topography on Nonlinear Internal Wave in Three-layer Flows**

2020/08 - 2021/06. UCAS, China

Advisor: [Prof. Zhan Wang](https://imech.cas.cn/people/zgj/default_94777.html?id=731)

*  Through asymptotic analysis, we derive governing equations for weakly nonlinear long wave (KdV and KP equation up to 5th order) in a three-layer shallow water model with topography. Then, we illustrate numerical results with selected representative topography settings.

**Material transport ability of flow induced by ocean internal waves**

2019/08 - 2020/12. UCAS, China

Advisor: [Prof. Zhan Wang](https://imech.cas.cn/people/zgj/default_94777.html?id=731)

*  We derived the mathematical expression for material transport by wave-induced flows. Then, we explore the characteristics of flows induced by KdV, MCC and DJL type internal waves, and discuss their ability in material transport and contributing factors respectively.
